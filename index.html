  <h1>Please admire Kai Kohlsdorf's awesome code.</h1>
  <h2>Look at all my beautiful cats, too! They represent my feelings about code.</h2>

    <p>About My Code: I'm new. But <em>awesome</em>. Look at me go.</p>
    <p>About My Cats: There are <span class="highlight">three</span>. They are very cute. 
      <ol>
        <li>They're siblings.</li>
        <li>They're one year old.</li>
        <li>They're tiny terrors. (Twinkie and Bear are actually pretty <strong>huge</strong> though, at 17 pounds each...)</li>
        <li>They think the computer is a toy--I think this means they're coders at heart.</li>
        <li>They break everything.</li>
        <li>Perhaps they'll help me fix bugs, since they like them so much?</li>
      </ol>
