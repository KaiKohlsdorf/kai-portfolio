    <div class="sidebar"><p>About My Cats: There are <span class="highlight">three</span>. They are very cute. 
      <ul>
        <li>They're siblings.</li>
        <li>They're one year old.</li>
        <li>They're tiny terrors. (Twinkie and Bear are actually pretty <strong>huge</strong> though, at 17 pounds each...)</li>
        <li>They think the computer is a toy--I think this means they're coders at heart.</li>
        <li>They break everything, but they also like to watch me fix it afterwards.</li>
        <li>Perhaps they'll help me fix bugs, since they like them so much?</li>
